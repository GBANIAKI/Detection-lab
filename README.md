# Detection-lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective]

The detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and and analyze logs within a security Information and Event management(SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack  scenarios.
This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack paaterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[bullet Points]
- Adavanced understanding of SIEM concepts and proactical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attacks signatures and paterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points]
- Security Information and event management (SIEM) sysyetm for log ingstion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools(such as wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic netowrk  traffic  and attack scenarios.
